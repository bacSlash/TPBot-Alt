Senture, LLC has actively participated in the GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MSA) under schedule # GS-35F-0623R, for over twenty (20) years as an acclaimed and award-winning company in the customer experience, contact center and Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) space.

The training staff at Senture successfully executed on the 2010 Census Call Center program. Nancy Workman’s professionalism and expertise gave me complete confidence that this mission-critical training program would be implemented flawlessly. Nancy not only met my expectations – she exceeded them!

I wanted to share with you the results of a survey HP conducted with the business owners who have recently used the FSD Help Line. HP randomly surveyed 30 of Senture’s callers between March 14th and 18th. I am happy to report that Senture’s FSD team delivered a perfect score, receiving 100% positive feedback. “In my 20-years experience, Senture is the most self-motivated and professional team I’ve had the pleasure of working with…

The agents did a really good job of explaining why the Veteran received the dialer call and they also explained the forms very clearly. They also nicely recapped what was needed at the end of the call, which at first concerned me about opening the door for more questions, but I then realized the value in doing that quick recap – nice touch. The new greeting is terrific – kudos to whoever it was that suggested the change – it gets right to the point and the agents all sound natural in using it…. the agents did a great job promoting the website – keep that up!

I only wish that the employees of HP could just half way measure up to your employees at Senture. You guys are clearly a cut above our personnel and we often point to you in trying to explain to them how important it is to strive to be better at their job.

. . . we chose Senture because of their outstanding staff. From the beginning, this company demonstrated the knowledge, sincerity, and interest to make us successful and be our business partner. This is exactly the kind of firm we needed. They have performed far beyond our expectations in every way. I would not hesitate to recommend them highly to anyone who needs a call center to provide inbound and outbound telesales support. Their lead generation and telesales activities far exceeded our own in-house staff. We never expected that.

Senture’s agents clearly do the best job of any of our call center partners in presenting the offer and handling the call.  The bank recognizes how important this is with so many institutions reaching out to the consumer with credit card offers.
